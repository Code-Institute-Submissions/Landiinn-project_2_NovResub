Welcome to my Project nr.2.

This was the first time trying javascript and I can honstly say, I need to focus more on this.
Although I am happy with the result, my credit goes to ="https://github.com/partha7978/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock/blob/main/scripts/script.js".

Most of the code is taken from here and modified to fit my needs. 
The result is beautiful, but not perfect.
My issues: I didn't manage to run a "roundlimit" and making it work. So it is a non-stop loop for now, and something I will return to.

The rules for the game is simple..
Pick a choice, and make the right one. 
If you don't, the computer gets the score, but if you do, then you'll get the score.
